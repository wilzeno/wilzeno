    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>For almost seven years, I've been helping clients of all shapes and sizes create beautiful and usable things.
       Having started my career in print design, I learned how to design for the web and to code website early on through professional experience and freelance work. I've had the opportunity to learn and collaborate with the best, at the top design firms like KAD ICT HUB.<p/>   
    	
    <p>I broadened my experience working as an in-house user experience designer at Wilzeno, as an application design consultant at a couple early stage start-ups, and as a design consultant with KAD ICT HUB. In each of these positions, in addition to designing, I've conducted research and user testing to inform the user experience and site structure.<p/>

      <p>
       In 2020, I decided to dedicate my professional time to working with my own clients. I love having the opportunity to learn about what my clients are passionate about, and to help them visualize what they'd like to portray to their audiences. From sustainable flooring to venture capital, and tiny start-ups to the biggest social network on the planet, diversity is what makes my job amazing.
       Not only are my clients diverse, but their projects are, as well. As an independent designer i can take on projects of all kinds, which allows me to tap into all of the experience i've accrued through the years. i design brochures, menus, business cards, books, annual reports, flyers, banners, powerpoint, keynote presentations, responsive websites and customized prints of t-shirts, mugs, plates.</p>
